    <li>FIXED/REWORKED issue <a href="https://github.com/jkriege2/JKQtPlotter/issues/111">#111: Can't write to PDF files with JKQTPlotter::saveImage() when passing a filename ending in ".pdf"</a> (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/fpalazzolo">user:fpalazzolo</a> for reporting):<br/>While fixing this issue, the functions JKQTBasePlotter::saveImage() etc. gained a bool return value to indicate whether sacing was successful.</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/FIXED outside space requirements for color bars. Text was sometime too close to the plot border.</li>
    <li>FIXED issue <a href="https://github.com/jkriege2/JKQtPlotter/issues/140">#140: addGraph function return value</a> by adding return values to all addGraph()-Variants in JKQTPlotter (to mirror the interface of JKQTBasePlotter), (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sajadblog">user:sajadblog</a></li>
    <li>REWORKED JKQTBasePlotter::saveData() with a more consistent interface and a bool return value to indicate success or failure + improved documentation, added methods to JKQTPSaveDataAdapter that allow to specify file extensions and an ID for the plugin.</li>
    <li>REWORKED: separation and gruping factor for barcharts on autoscaling</li>
    <li>REORGANIZED: separated line-graphs from jkqtpscatter.h/.cpp into jkqtplines.h/.cpp</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: QT6-compatibility by removing deprecated warnings</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: added missing override declarations</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: JKQTPlotter::jkqtp_RESIZE_DELAY is thread-safe now (atomic)</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: Using axis's tick label formating properties to format values in data-tooltips (e.g. dates will appear formated as such)</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: reworked JKQTPErrorPlotstyle and error indicator plotting so error-inidcators can be specified as ORed combination of flags from JKQTPErrorPlotstyleElements, added additional error indicator styles (half-bars, arrows...)</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: reworked JKQTPCADrawMode and coordinate axis drawing so the draw mide can be specified as ORed combination of flags from JKQTPCADrawModeElements, added flags to draw arrows at the end of the axis line</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: coordinate axis code was refactored</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: zomm/pan by mouse-wheel: now there are modes that support zoomin AND panning by trakpad and mouse-wheel simultaneously! This can only be implemented using heuristics, due to the way that Qt handles track-pad events, but the current solution should at least improve the behaviour seen before. Mainly <code>jkqtpmwaZoomByWheelAndTrackpadPan</code> was introduced into <code>JKQTPMouseWheelActions</code> und is set as default mode: Here JKQTPlotter tries to distinguish the QWheelEvent s sent by an actual mouse wheel and a trackpad.</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: better example graphs in \ref JKQTPlotterStyling  .</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: legend/key positioning as combination of 3 values, e.g. \c JKQTPKeyOutsideTop|JKQTPKeyTop|JKQTPKeyRight or \c JKQTPKeyInside|JKQTPKeyTopJKQTPKeyRight</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: The functions JKQTBasePlotter::saveImage(), JKQTBasePlotter::saveAsPixelImage(), JKQTBasePlotter::saveAsPDF(), JKQTBasePlotter::saveSVG(), ... gained a bool return value to indicate whether sacing was successful.</li>
    <li>IMPROVED/REWORKED: More <code>save...()</code> functions will appear in the API of JKQTPlotter, so you don't have to go via JKQTPlotter::getPlotter(). These are merely forwarding the call to the internel JKQTBasePlotter instance.</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: documentation of styles: automatized doc image generation.</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: axis labeling: there were some minor differences between compilers</li>
    <li>IMPROVED: jkqtp_floattounitstr()/jkqtp_floattolatexunitstr(): add all SI-Prefixes from 10^-30...10^30</li>
    <li>RENAMED JKQTPDatastore::addColumnCalculatedFromColumn() to JKQTPDatastore::addCalculatedColumnFromColumn(), which is more in line with the other add...()-function names. Aliases with the old function names remain for compatibility</li>
    <li>NEW: JKQTPFilledCurveXGraph and JKQTPFilledCurveYGraph can now plot wiggle plots with different fill styles above and below the baseline (feature request <a href="https://github.com/jkriege2/JKQtPlotter/issues/68">#68 Wiggle Plots</a> from <a href="https://github.com/xichaoqiang">user:xichaoqiang</a>   </li>
    <li>NEW/BREAKING CHANGE: data tooltip can now also be shown when "just" moving the mouse (so far this was only possible when dragging the mouse with a button pressed). This also removes JKQtPlotter::getActMouseLeftAsToolTip() and adds JKQtPlotter::getActMouseMoveToolTip() instead! Also the default toolbars and context menus changed!</li>
    <li>NEW: new "seaborn" style for plots, see \ref jkqtpplotter_styling </li>
    <li>NEW/BREAKING CHANGE: changed JKQTPColorDerivationMode into a struct, which extends its capabilities above the previously available few enum-items</li>
    <li>NEW: added debug-feature to show boxes around text in the plot</li>
    <li>BREAKING: Print-Support can now be switched off with a CMAKE-option JKQtPlotter_BUILD_FORCE_NO_PRINTER_SUPPORT=ON. This also switches off PDF and SVG export, partly solves issue <a href="https://github.com/jkriege2/JKQtPlotter/issues/81">#81</a>, many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sufuk">user:sufuk</a> for contributing part of the code and supplying the idea!  </li>
    <li>NEW: improved plotting speed for line-graphs by drawing a series of single lines instead of a polyline in some cases</li>
    <li>NEW: improved plotting speed for line-graphs by a compression algorithm (see JKQTPGraphLinesCompressionMixin) that removes overlaying lines (e.g. in JKQTPXYLineGraph)</li>
    <li>NEW: improved plotting speed for line-graphs by a clipping algorithm (applies to JKQTPXYLineGraph, JKQTPGraphErrorStyleMixin, JKQTPSpecialLineHorizontalGraph, JKQTPSpecialLineVerticalGraph and others)</li>
    <li>NEW: improved plotting speed for scatter-graphs by not calling draw functions for symbols outside the plot window (e.g. in JKQTPXYLineGraph)</li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTBasePlotter::grabPixelImage() and JKQTPlotter::grabPixelImage(), which grab the plotter into a QImage</li>
    <li>NEW: added option to not display the preview dialog to JKQTBasePlotter::copyPixelImage() and JKQTPlotter::copyPixelImage()</li>
    <li>NEW: added simple scatter plot JKQTPXYScatterGraph</li>
    <li>NEW: made resize-timer status accessible from outside via JKQTPlotter::isResizeTimerRunning() </li>
    <li>NEW: made it's delay a global static variable that can be set and red with JKQTPlotter::setGlobalResizeDelay() and JKQTPlotter::getGlobalResizeDelay()</li>
    <li>NEW: Using JKQTMathText::useGuiFonts() for FONT rendering by default</li>
    <li>NEW: added the option to draw a character from a font as symbol (<code>JKQTPCharacterSymbol+QChar('C').unicode()</code> and <code>JKQTPFilledCharacterSymbol+QChar('C').unicode()</code>)</li>
    <li>NEW: added the option to register a custom symbol using JKQTPRegisterCustomGraphSymbol() </li>
    <li>NEW: added property drawLineInForeground to JKQTPXYLineGraph and JKQTPXYParametrizedScatterGraph</li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTPXYGraph::setKeyColumn()/JKQTPXYGraph::getKeyColumn() and  JKQTPXYGraph::setValueColumn()/JKQTPXYGraph::getValueColumn() and corresponding functions in other classes. In most graph classes they point to xColumn for key and yColumn for values. These functions are virtual and overwritten in derived classes with horizontally oriented graphs, where they point to yColumn for key and yColumn for value. This way you can write generic code with classes for both orientations.</li>
    <li>NEW: added new error indicator styles JKQTPErrorHalfBarsOutwards, JKQTPErrorHalfBarsInwards, JKQTPErrorHalfBarsAbove, JKQTPErrorHalfBarsBelow which are especially useful for barcharts</li>
    <li>NEW: Added signals JKQTBasePlotter::beforeExporting()/JKQTBasePlotter::afterExporting() and JKQTBasePlotterJKQTBasePlotter:beforePrinting()/JKQTBasePlotter::afterPrinting() which allow to modify the plot just before and just after an export/print</li>
    <li>NEW: Added new JKQTPCALabelType elements (JKQTPCALTfrac...), so axis label ticks can be displayed as fractions 1/2 instead of 0.5<br>
                       JKQTPCALTscientific, so axis label ticks can be displayed as numbers in scientific notation like \c 1.2E-34<br>
                       JKQTPCALTprintf for general formatting with a printf-format string <br>
                       JKQTPCALTformat for general formatting with a std::format-format string (available for C++>=20 only!!!)</li>
    <li>NEW: all elements of a coordinate axis may have their own color now </li>
    <li>NEW: added possibility to scale the axis ticks by a factor (e.g. pi) to generate axes with ticks <tt>0pi, 1pi, 2pi ...</tt> </li>
    <li>NEW: added option to draw a zero axis to JKQTPCoordinateAxis, which draws an axis at the origin of the coordinate system  </li>
    <li>NEW: barcharts (derived from JKQTPBarGraphBase) can be configured to use different fill styles above and below the baseline, see JKQTPBarGraphBase::FillMode </li>
    <li>NEW: barcharts may have rounded corners now, via JKQTPBarGraphBase::setRectRadius()</li>
    <li>NEW: barcharts can be colored by a user-specified functor</li>
    <li>NEW: you can provide a custom draw functor to barcharts to completely customize their look</li>
    <li>NEW: barcharts and impulse graphs may now draw their baseline as stylable line (default: off)</li>
    <li>NEW: secondary axes: added functionality to manage additional secondary axes in a JKQTPBasePlotter and to select which x-/y-Axis to use for drawing a JKQTPPlotElement</li>
    <li>NEW: You can use additional syntax derived from CCS to define colors in style.ini.files (or when using  jkqtp_String2QColor() ): You can use full CSS-color syntax with functions <code>"rgb(R,G,B)"</code>, <code>"rgba(...)"</code>, <code>"hsl(...)"</code>, <code>"hsv(...)"</code>, <code>"gray(...)"</code>, <code>"green(...)"</code>, <code>"red(...)"</code>, <code>"blue(...)"</code>.</li>
    <li>NEW: several new color palettes (especially stepped/categorial palettes), e.g. JKQTPMathImageColorPalette::JKQTPMathImageOkabeIto_STEP, JKQTPMathImageColorPalette::JKQTPMathImageIBMColorBlindSafe, JKQTPMathImageColorPalette::JKQTPMathImageIBMColorBlindSafe_STEP, ...</li>
    <li>NEW: add color palettes from Green's HELIX method, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5083">https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5083</a>, also see <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/cubehelix/">https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/cubehelix/</a>, see JKQTPCreateGreensCubeHelixLUT() and e.g. JKQTPMathImageCubeHelixClassic, JKQTPMathImageCubeHelix1, ...</li>
    <li>NEW: Using Q_SIGNALS/Q_SLOTS instead of signals/slots MOC-keywords ... this allows for interoperability with other signals/slots frameworks, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nickmontini">user:nickmontini</a> for the proposal</li>
    <li>NEW: you can use any (preferably stepped/categorial) JKQTPMathImageColorPalette as default graph colors list in a style.ini file, by setting <tt>auto_styles/use_color_from_palette=PALETTE_NAME</tt></li>
    <li>NEW: added entry for JKQTBasePlotterStyle::plotLabelColor to set the plot label color</li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTBasePlotterStyle::plotLabelTopBorder to set the  spacing between top and plot label</li>
    <li>NEW: Due to addition of JKQTMathText::setFontOptions() and the matchign extension of JKQTMathText::setFontSpecial() (see below) you can now add modifiers like <tt>+BOLD+ITALIC</tt> to any font-name provided to JKQTPlotter and in style INI-files</li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTPLabelMinBesides and JKQTPLabelMaxBesides to JKQTPLabelPosition, so labels can be set besides the axes</li>
    <li>NEW/REWORKED all functions in JKQTBasePlotter are re-entrant, i.e. different instances can be used from different threads in parallel (although there is some overhead due to shared caches between the threads!). This is demonstrated and discussed in \ref JKQTPlotterMultiThreaded . </li>
    <li>NEW: allow linear-gradient(), currentcolor, ... in brush definitions of style.ini-file ... and using it is cyberpunk and dark styles</li>
    <li>NEW: style simple_noaxes.ini</li>
    <li>NEW: JKQTPXYGraphLabels which can draw a label next to each datapoint in the given x/y-dataset. The labels can be x-/y- or x&y-coordinates or custom, then defined by a user-supplied functor (+example \ref JKQTPlotterGraphLabelsExample)</li>
    <li>NEW: Base class JKQTPXYAndVectorGraph for graphs like vector fields, e.g. (x,y,dx,dy) or (x,y,angle,length) </li>

    <li>NEW: JKQTPGeoBezierCurve for drawing bezier curves of degree 1-4 (+example \ref JKQTPlotterGeometricBezier)</li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTPCoordinateAxis::setRangeFixed() which disables changing the axis range (and thus the zoom)</li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTPCoordinateAxis::getMin() and JKQTPCoordinateAxis::getMax() getters</li>
    <li>NEW: added example \ref JKQTPlotterUIScrollbar </li>
    <li>NEW: added JKQTPlotterUpdateGuard guard class that prevents redrawing of a JKQTPlotter during the lifetime of a code block, improved documentation of speed during plot setup</li>
  </ul></li>
